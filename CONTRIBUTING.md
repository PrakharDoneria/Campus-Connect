# Contributing to Campus Connect

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Campus Connect! We're excited to build this platform with the community. As a project built for students, we especially welcome contributions from students who want to learn and grow their skills.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes and feature development to documentation improvements and UI/UX enhancements.

### Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the project to work on.
2.  **Clone your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/prakhardoneria/Campus-Connect.git`
3.  **Create a branch**: Make a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature`).
4.  **Make your changes**: Write your code and tests. See our tech stack in the `README.md`.
5.  **Commit your changes**: Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for your commit messages. This helps us automate changelogs.
    - Example: `feat: add video call functionality to chat`
    - Example: `fix: resolve issue with friend request notifications`
6.  **Push to your branch**: `git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature`.
7.  **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a PR to the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and link any relevant issues.

### Code Style

- We follow standard TypeScript and React best practices. Use functional components with hooks.
- Leverage the existing `shadcn/ui` components for building UI elements to maintain consistency.
- Write clear, commented (where necessary), and modular code.

### Finding an Issue to Work On

Check out the "Issues" tab in our GitHub repository. We label issues with `good first issue` for newcomers. Feel free to ask questions on an issue before you start working on it.

### Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure your PR is focused on a single issue or feature.
2.  Provide a clear and descriptive title for your PR.
3.  In the PR description, explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.
4.  Make sure your code passes all linting and build checks. We have CI checks in place that must pass before a PR can be merged.

We appreciate your help in making Campus Connect a great tool for students everywhere!
